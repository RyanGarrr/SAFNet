## Preparation
###Environment Preparation & Data Preparation

Thanks for the detaied instructions of [MVPNet](https://github.com/maxjaritz/mvpnet). 

We prepared our environment and [ScanNet data](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannet_benchmark/) following the practice of MVPNet:

Environment: 

  - Python 3.6
  - Pytorch 1.2.0
  - CUDA 10.0 & CUDNN 7.6.4
 
DATA: 

  The data is released under the [ScanNet Term of Use](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannet/ScanNet_TOS.pdf), please contact ScanNet team for access.

The code is coming soon.
